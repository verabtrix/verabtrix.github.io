> **NCT or also known as Neo Culture Technology, a K-pop group launched by SM Entertainment, debuted in 2016. It has a very unique concept as it is a group made up of an unlimited number of members divided into multiple sub-units. Currently, NCT has 23 members and four different units which are NCT U, NCT Dream, WayV and NCT 127.**
## **NCT U** 
> **NCT U is the first unit to debut and the one that represents NCT’s concept the most. This unit doesn’t have fixed members and unites members from other units to create different combinations to fit different concepts. Sometimes, new members are also introduced through this unit, which happened with Shotaro and Sungchan, who debuted with the project NCT 2020. Another example of this happened in NCT 2018 when Kun was included as part of the team, completing 18 members at that time.**

NCT 127 was the second unit to debut in 2016, and it’s a Seoul-based group that represents the concept of spreading K-pop from Korea to the world. Even though the number 127 stands for the longitude of Seoul, the group combines members from different countries like Canada, the United States and Japan. From the oldest to the youngest, the members are: Taeil, Johnny, Taeyong, Yuta, Doyoung, Jaehyun, Winwin, Jungwoo, Mark and Haechan, however, Winwin hasn’t been participating in any NCT 127 activity since the release of their 4th mini album NCT#127 We Are Superhuman in 2019.
